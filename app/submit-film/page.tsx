                <p className="font-texta text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-3 sm:mb-4">
                  <strong>Short Film Duration:</strong> Films must follow the time limits of their category (either 10 minutes or 5 minutes). There's no minimum length, but even very short films should fit meaningfully within a category.
                </p>
                <p className="font-texta text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-3 sm:mb-4">
                  <strong>Completion Date:</strong> Films must have been completed between <strong>January 1, 2024, and December 30, 2025</strong>. Only finished films are accepted; works in progress are not eligible.

                  <strong>Production:</strong> The festival focuses on <strong>independent cinema</strong>. Your film should be made independently, not as a commercial studio production. Sponsors or grants are fine, but the creative control must remain with the filmmaker.

                <p className="font-texta text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-3 sm:mb-4">

                  <strong>Geographical Focus:</strong> The festival is open to everyone, but we especially encourage entries from <strong>filmmakers from Madhya Pradesh</strong> or films connected to <strong>Madhya Pradesh/Central India</strong> – whether through story, setting, or production. This includes films based in or shot in Madhya Pradesh or made by filmmakers from the state. Highlighting your MP connection can strengthen your submission.

                  <strong>Prior Screenings:</strong> Films don't need to be premieres. You can submit films that have screened elsewhere or are online. However, showing something new or lesser known to local audiences adds excitement. If your film has won awards or been shown before, mention it in the form – it won't affect your eligibility.

                  <strong>Feedback:</strong> Due to time limits, the festival cannot provide individual feedback. If a film isn't selected, it doesn't mean it wasn't good; sometimes it's about fitting the schedule or theme. Filmmakers are encouraged to keep creating and try again in future editions.
