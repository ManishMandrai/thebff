                  You confirm that you are the <strong>rightful owner</strong> of the film or have the necessary authority/permission to submit it. If you are submitting on behalf of a team, you must have consent from all producers/rights-holders. You must also have permission from any third-party rights holders (e.g., music composers, stock footage providers).

                  Your film <strong>must not contain</strong> any content that <strong>violates copyright</strong> or intellectual property rights. All music, footage, images, or graphics must be original or properly licensed. The festival will <strong>NOT BE liable</strong> for copyright infringements, with responsibility lying solely with the applicant/filmmaker.

                <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  The festival <strong>will not accept films that contain hateful or malicious content</strong>. Specifically, we disallow content that <strong>promotes racism, hate speech, communal or religious disharmony, gender discrimination, extreme violence towards animals, or serves as propaganda</strong> for any extremist ideology. Pornography or material illegal under Indian laws will also not be screened. Films violating these guidelines will be disqualified.

                <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  While Indian law generally requires censorship clearance for public screenings, the festival will obtain an <strong>exemption from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC)</strong> for festival screenings. Therefore, a <strong>CBFC certificate is NOT required</strong> for submission or selection. If a film is already CBFC certified, only that version will be screened. Otherwise, the festival will apply for a <strong>one-time screening exemption from the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (Govt. of India)</strong> on behalf of all selected films. Submitting implies agreement to cooperate with this process. It notes that the exemption process is usually routine for recognized festivals, and filmmakers typically don't need to do anything, but may be asked for an undertaking or information in rare cases. All screened films will have either a CBFC certificate or an official exemption letter.

                <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Films should not be under any pending <strong>legal disputes or litigation</strong> that could affect their screening. Any court injunctions or disputes must be resolved or disclosed before submission. Misrepresentation can lead to disqualification.

                <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-bold mb-3 sm:mb-4 uppercase">INSTITUTIONAL FILMS</h2>
                <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  For films produced by a film institute, university, government agency, or organization, an <strong>NOC (No Objection Certificate)</strong> or written permission from the relevant authority is required for submission and screening. Examples: a student diploma film needs the institute's nod; a funded film needs organizational permission. Proof of such permission may be requested if the film is selected.

                  By entering, the filmmaker grants The Bhopal Film Festival <strong>the rights to screen your film</strong> (if selected) <strong>without any screening fee</strong>. Permission is also granted to use <strong>promotional materials</strong> (stills, trailers, clips, film title, synopsis) in the festival catalogue, website, social media, and press releases for marketing.

                <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  The festival will not pay any screening fee, licensing fee, or shipping cost. We assume submitters understand this for an indie festival with free submission and non-commercial intent. Physical media or materials submitted will not be returned. Since the process is primarily online, this likely doesn't apply. The festival also cannot provide insurance for any tapes/drives sent, preferring online submission to avoid this.
